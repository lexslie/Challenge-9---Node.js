## Description
This is a sample README file created to demonstrate the functionality of Project 9 using Node.js

## Installation
To install the application, the user must first download the inquirer package in order to be able to use the node.js function. After doing so, the user must clone the repository to access the application.

## Usage
The application will assist users in saving time while creating their personal README files in order to dedicate more of their time to the actual code of their projects' functionality. 

## Contributing
Whent the contributing to the project please make sure to create your own branch to contribute to in order to avoid contributing possible errors to the original code.

## Tests
When testing the application, make sure to have the repo open on your local computer. Through your terminal, run the function 'node index.js', which will then prompt you with questions to fill your README content. After submitting the content asked for, redirect to your local repo to make sure everything is correct. Once you upload the newly produced README to your github, you will have a nicely created README file added onto your repo.
